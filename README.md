# 🧠 Problems
I create this repository for solutions to coding problems from different platforms.

## 📂 Folders
Each folder represents a platform, then organized by difficulty or topic.

## 🛠️ Languages
Solutions are implemented in C++. I choose this language because I want to learn in the raw.

## 🎯 Purpose
- Improve problem solving and algorithmic thinking.
- This is my personal reference library.
- Organize what I've learned.
